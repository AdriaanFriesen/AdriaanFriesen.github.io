        <h1>How to Python, at a basic level</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Python is an object oriented interpreted langauge, meaning it's not compiled like C or Java is, but just run as is. It it fairly easy to learn compared to other languages, and is a very powerful tool when raw execution speed is not the main concern.</p>

        <h2><a name="chapter1">Basic Syntax and Functions</a></h2>
        <p>First, lets start with the <code>print()</code> function. As you might expect, it prints whatever's inside to the console. To print text, the text to be printed must be inside of either single quotes or double quotes. Here's an example:</p>
        <p class="code">print("Hello World!")</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>Hello World!</p>
        <p>It prints <code>Hello World!</code> to the console. We can also print variables to console. But how do we set a variable? Like this!</p>
        <p class="code">var_1 = "Hello"<br>var_2 = "World"<br>print(var_1)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>Hello</p>
        <p>Notice how there were no quotes when we used the name of a variable. You may have also noticed how there were two variables, and they form <code>Hello World</code> together, but how do we put them together? We can use the <code>+</code> operator on strings to concatenate them to each other.</p>
        <p class="code">var_1 = "Hello"<br>var_2 = "World"<br>print(var_1 + var_2)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>HelloWorld</p>
        <p>That works, but there was no space in between. All we have to do to fix this is add a space between them. We'll add a space into the <code>print</code> function.</p>
        <p class="code">var_1 = "Hello"<br>var_2 = "World"<br>print(var_1 + " " + var_2)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>Hello World</p>
        <p>Variables can be of other types as well. For example, we can set a variable to an integer.</p>
        <p class="code">number = 5<br>print(number)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>5</p>
        <p>We can also perform operations on numbers, like this:</p>
        <p class="code">number = 17<br>other_number = 5<br>new_number = number + other_number<br>print(new_number)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>22</p>
        <p>Now lets say that we want to print both letters and numbers. This might be your first guess:</p>
        <p class="code">word = "hello"<br>number = 4<br>print(word + number)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;<br>TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str</p>
        <p>It didn't work. But why? Python can only add varables of the same type. If we check the type of our varables using the <code>type()</code> function, we can see that they are different.</p>
        <p class="code">word = "hello"<br>number = 4<br>print(type(word))<br>print(type(number))</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>&lt;class 'str'&gt;<br>&lt;class 'int'&gt;</p>
        <p>Now we see that word is of type <code>str</code> and number is of type <code>int</code>. Can we covert number to a str type so it can be printed? Yes!</p>
        <p class="code">word = "hello"<br>number = 4<br>print(word + str(number))</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>hello4</p>
        <p>We used the <code>str()</code> function to convert the variable given to a <code>str</code> type so it could concatenate to <code>word</code>. There are other types of variables, like floating point numbers, which can contain decimals, lists, which host any number of other variables inside them, dictionaries, which contain a number of key-value pairs, and more.</p>

        <h2><a name="chapter2">In-depth Variables</a></h2>
        <p>In Python, there are many types of variables. We have already seen <code>int</code> and <code>str</code> types of variables, but there are others. Lets first take a look at a <code>float</code> type variable:</p>
        <p class="code">float_number = 4.76<br>print(float_number)<br>print(type(float_number))</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>4.76<br>&lt;class 'float'&gt;</p>
        <p>We can see that we were able to store a floating point number and see that it was of type <code>float</code>. Lets take a look at the code below.</p>
        <p class="code">num_1 = 7<br>num_2 = 2<br>num_3 = num_1 / num_2<br>print(type(num_1))<br>print(type(num_2))<br>print(type(num_3))<br>print(num_3)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>&lt;class 'int'&gt;<br>&lt;class 'int'&gt;<br>&lt;class 'float'&gt;<br>3.5</p>
        <p>We can see that even though we started with two integers, we ended with a float. This is an example of Python's implicit variable declaration. Even though we didn't explicitly tell Python to make <code>num_3</code> a floating point number, it did it anyways because 7 divided by 2 is 3.5, which is not an integer. Sometimes we dont want Python to use the most specific type of variable possible, for example putting an integer into a <code>float</code> type variable. We can use the variable functions we saw in the last chapter to do this.</p>
        <p class="code">int_in_a_float = float(4)<br>print(int_in_a_float)<br>print(type(int_in_a_float))</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>4.0<br>&lt;class 'float'&gt;</p>
        <p>Notice how <code>float</code> variables always have decimal points, even when there is no decimal value. Lets now take a look at <code>list</code> type variables. They hold any number of other variables inside them, and can be changed after they are created. To make a list, we put brackets around the items of the list, which are separated by commas.</p>
        <p class="code">first_list = [5, 4.9, "youch"]<br>print(first_list)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>[5, 4.9, 'youch']</p>
        <p>Now lets say that we want to access a specific list item. We can use list indexes to do this. To use a list index, we put the list name and a number inside brackets at the end of the name where the number is the index of the list item we want to access. It's easier explained through an example:</p>
        <p class="code">first_list = [5, 4.9, "youch"]<br>print(first_list[1])</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>4.9</p>
        <p>Python gave us the list element with index 1. This was not the first list element though, because indexes in Python start at 0. This means that <code>youch</code> has a list index of 2. We can even put lists inside of other lists to create nested lists. To change a list is to set a list index equal to a different value.</p>
        <p class="code">other_list = ["one", 2, 3]<br>print(other_list)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>['one', 2, 3]</p>
        <p>Now we have a list with an arguably incorrect element. Lets change this to be the "correct" value.</p>
        <p class="code">other_list = ["one", 2, 3]<br>print("Wrong list:")<br>print(other_list)<br>other_list[0] = 1<br>print("Correct list:")<br>print(other_list)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>Wrong list:<br>['one', 2, 3]<br>Correct list:<br>[1, 2, 3]</p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2><a name="chapter3">Loops and Conditionals</a></h2>
        <p>Loops and conditional statements are an important part of any programming language, and Python is no different. First lets start with the <code>if</code> statement. It takes a variable or other conditional and performs the functions inside of it if the input is true. We'll also be introducing boolean variables, which store either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
        <p class="code">boolean_var = True<br>if boolean_var:<br>    print("Hello")</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>Hello</p>
        <p>Since <code>boolean_var</code> was <code>True</code>, the <code>if</code> statement executed what was inside it. Notice how in Python, loops and conditionals use whitespace to indicate what is and what is not inside the statement. This is why there was an indent before <code>print("Hello")</code>.</p>
        <p><code>if</code> statements can also can code that executes if the check failed. This is the <code>else</code> keyword.</p>
        <p class="code">new_boolean = False<br>if new_boolean:<br>    print("Hello")<br>else:<br>    print("Goodbye")</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>Goodbye</p>
        <p>The code inside the <code>else</code> statement executed because the <code>if</code> check failed. There is one more statement that goes with <code>if</code>, which is the <code>elif</code> keyword. It is executed if the initial check fails, and has its own check. There can be unlimited <code>elif</code> statements in a single <code>if</code> statement.</p>
        <p class="code">response = 2<br>if response = 1:<br>    print("Good Morning")<br>elif response = 2:<br>    print("Good Afternoon")<br>elif response = 3:<br>    print("Good Night")</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>Good Afternoon</p>
        <p>That's the <code>if</code> statement. Now lets see the <code>while</code> loop. It executes the code inside it until the conditional given to it is false. We'll also see the <code>+=</code> operator. It adds whatever is on the right of the operator to what's on the left. As an example, <code>var = var + 1</code> is equivalent to <code>var += 1</code>.</p>
        <p class="code">counter = 0<br>while counter &lt; 5:<br>    counter += 1<br>    print(counter)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5</p>
        <p>The final loop we'll look at is the <code>for</code> loop. It performs an action for every variable in an iterable. An iterable is just something that can be accessed through an index value, for example the lists we looked at in the last chapter.</p>
        <p class="code">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>total = 0<br>for number in numbers:<br>    total += number<br>print("List:")<br>print(numbers)<br>print("List total:")<br>print(total)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>List:<br>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>List total:<br>15</p>
        <p>We successfully added the contents of the list into one number. This is one of many things <code>for</code> loops can do.</p>

        <h2><a name="chapter4">External Libraries</a></h2>
        <p>One of the core design philosophies of the Python language is that the base set of functions should be lightweight, and imports should be relied upon instead. This is what the <code>import</code> keyword is for. They go at the top of your file, and import all the functions and classes from the referenced library. There are multiple ways to obtain libraries, but that won't be covered in this tutorial. Instead, we'll use one of the many libraries that are included with a standard installation of Python. We'll be demonstrating imports with the <code>random</code> library. As you might guess, it does all sorts of things with random numbers.</p>
        <p class="code">import random</p>
        <p>Now we've imported the <code>random</code> module. Lets do something with it, like the <code>randint()</code> function. It takes two integers as input, the minimum and maximum number it can generate. For example, <code>randint(0, 5)</code> would generate a random integer between 0 and 5, inclusive.</p>
        <p class="code">import random<br>random_number = random.randint(0, 7)<br>print(random_number)</p>
        <p class="code">Output:<br>2</p>
        <p>We rolled a 2, but it could have been any number between 0 and 7. You might have also noticed that we used <code>random.randint()</code> instead of just <code>randint()</code>. This is how you tell Python that the function you're using comes from a library, by putting the library name, a period, then the function name.</p>
